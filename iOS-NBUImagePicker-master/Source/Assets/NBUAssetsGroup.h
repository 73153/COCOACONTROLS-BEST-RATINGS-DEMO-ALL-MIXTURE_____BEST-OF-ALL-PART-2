@class ALAssetsGroup;

/**
 Wrapper to ease acces to an ALAssetsGroup assets group.
 
 - Unlike ALAssetsGroup objects, NBUAssetsGroup is always valid.
 - Observes ALAssetsLibraryChangedNotification to reload its associated
 ALAssetsGroup if needed.
 - Lazily loads posterImage and assets' count only when needed.
 - Leverages iOS4 compatibility by creating a NSURL:
 `assets-library://group/?id=<ALAssetsGroupPropertyPersistentID>`.
 
 @note You usually retrieve assets groups using NBUAssetTypesLibrary methods.
