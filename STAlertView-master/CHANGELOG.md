## 0.2.0

### Avoid auto show call
* The library does not automatically call the show method, now you have to call [stalertview show] to make visible the alertview.
* All the methods that contained "otherButtonTitles" have been renamed to "otherButtonTitle" (from plural to singular).

## 0.1.0

### Alertview with textfields
* Now you can show a UIAlertView with a textfiled, call the method: [initWithTitle: message: textFieldHint: textFieldValue: cancelButtonTitle: otherButtonTitles: cancelButtonBlock: otherButtonBlock:]
* Added some documentation
